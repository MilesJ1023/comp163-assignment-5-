For challenge 1: The Collatz Conjecture 
You start with a number and run it through a while loop. If the number is even it will keep dividing until it hits 1 while if its odd it will multiply by 3 and add 1 The while loop work here because we don't know how many times it will until it gets to 1

For challenge 2: Prime Number Checker:
You check if a number is prime by testing if it can be divided evenly by any number from 2 up to one less than itself. The for loop works here because you know exactly how many numbers you want to check,.You go through all possible divisors step by step.

For challenge 3: Multiplication Table
You print out a multiplication table from 1 to 10. Two for loops work best because you want to go through every row and every column in order, itâ€™s like going through a grid, row by row, column by column.

Used CHATAI to help me understand spacing part of Multiplication Table part as I got stuck.
